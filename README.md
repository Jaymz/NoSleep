# NoSleep
Incredibly simple utility to disable automatic locking of workstation when enforced by GPO. 

Useful when presenting something not full screen.

Put the application somewhere in your PATH to be able to just `Win+R nosleep` whenever you want to disable the automatic screen locking. Re-enable screen locking by killing the task in task manager.
